Help file for python-fu photolab_webgallery.py

Option :
This Python-fu will use PIL if found and then will get faster
PIL : http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

Object : 
Make a photo gallery for the web. An exemple can be seen here:
http://raymond.ostertag.free.fr/voyages/canada/index_1.html
Features include comments and a diaporama mode, the format is 
XHTML+CSS2 and a external theme is downloadable at 
http://www.gimp-fr.org/contrib_photolabo.php

Menu :
Filters / Photolab / Gallery / Web Gallery


Parameters :

Directory = working directory in which the original images are

Extension = only the files with this extension will be treated

Title = the big title on top of the gallery

Footer = the footer on bottom of the gallery

HTML Path to Méta-index = the link to a top index or summary of your galleries

HTML Path to Theme = the relative location where to find the CSS theme,
usually it's "../theme" for a general theme and "theme" for a specific
theme

Thumbnails Size = give here the maximal size of the BIGGEST border for
the thumbnails

Scaled Size =  give here the maximal size of the SMALLER border for
the images in the gallery

Full Size = give here the maximal size of the SMALLER border for
the images when they are seen in full size

Time between two slides = timing of the diaporama


Text files :

File "title.txt" = if found in the working directory its content is
used as title for the gallery. The parameter title is then no more used.

File "footer.txt" = if found in the working directory its content is
used as footer for the gallery. The parameter footer is then no more used.

File "metaindex.txt" = if found in the working directory its content is
used as meta-index for the gallery. The parameter meta-index is then no more used.

File "comment.txt" = if found in the working directory its content is
used as comments for the gallery. If notfound then the comment is the
filename of the image. Of course the file comment.txt should have so many
entries as images. You can first use the python-fu "photolab_filerename"
and then use a text editor in which you can see the line numbers.


Troubles :

If encoding of text file is not the one of the system then you can force
the encoding in the Python-fu at the section "System locale"

BIGGEST and SMALLER border is a pain. But think if you'd like to put
some panoramics pictures in your gallery it will be criminal to cut it
just to fit into a gallery. An exemple:

Image in fullsize is an option. If you give a fullsize value lesser than
the scaledsize value then the fullsize images won't be created. I think
that fullsize is not useful for the web (too big) but it's nice on a 
cederom to show to the family.

You should delete by hand the original images. In fact you'd better
archive them :)

There is no cache, each you time you run the program all is redone again,
that could be long...
