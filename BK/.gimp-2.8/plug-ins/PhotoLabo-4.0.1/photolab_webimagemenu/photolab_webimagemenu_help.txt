Dépendencies :
PIL : http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

Object : 
Make a image menu or a small photo gallery for the web. An exemple of
image menu can be seen here: http://raymond.ostertag.free.fr/voyages/
Features include comments and long description, the format is XHTML+CSS2 
and a external theme is downloadable at
http://www.gimp-fr.org/contrib_photolabo.php

Menu :
Filters / Photolab / Gallery / Web Image Menu


Parameters :

Directory = working directory in which the original images are

Extension = only the files with this extension will be treated

Title = the big title on top of the gallery

Footer = the footer on bottom of the gallery

HTML Path to Méta-index = the link to a top index or summary of your galleries

HTML Path to Theme = the relative location where to find the CSS theme,
usually it's "../theme" for a general theme and "theme" for a specific
theme

Thumbnails Size = give here the maximal size of the BIGGEST border for
the thumbnails

Scaled Size =  give here the maximal size of the SMALLER border for
the images in the gallery

Full Size = give here the maximal size of the SMALLER border for
the images when they are seen in full size


Text files :

File "title.txt" = if found in the working directory its content is
used as title for the gallery. The parameter title is then no more used.

File "footer.txt" = if found in the working directory its content is
used as footer for the gallery. The parameter footer is then no more used.

File "metaindex.txt" = if found in the working directory its content is
used as meta-index for the gallery. The parameter meta-index is then no more used.

File "comment.txt" = if found in the working directory its content is
used as comments for the gallery. If notfound then the comment is the
filename of the image. 
NOTE: Of course the file comment.txt should have so many
entries as images. You can first use the python-fu "photolab_filerename"
and then use a text editor in which you can see the line numbers.

File "description.txt" = if found in the working directory its content is
added on top of each image. In this kind of tgallery you'd better give a 
very small comment and a long description in this file. The content
can include HTML tag.
NOTE: same as for "comment.txt"

File "link.txt" = if found in the working directory its content is
used as link for each image. It's this file that make you switch between
a small gallery and a image menu. When you create this file when you click
on the selected image you don't acces to the fullsize image anymore but to
the given link.
NOTE: same as for "comment.txt"


Troubles :

If encoding of text file is not the one of the system then you can force
the encoding in the Python-fu at the section "System locale"

BIGGEST and SMALLER border is a pain. But think if you'd like to put
some panoramics pictures in your gallery it will be criminal to cut it
just to fit into a gallery. An exemple:

Image in fullsize is an option. If you give a fullsize value lesser than
the scaledsize value then the fullsize images won't be created. I think
that fullsize is not useful for the web (too big) but it's nice on a 
cederom to show to the family.

You should delete by hand the original images. In fact you'd better
archive them :)

There is no cache, each you time you run the program all is redone again,
that could be long...
