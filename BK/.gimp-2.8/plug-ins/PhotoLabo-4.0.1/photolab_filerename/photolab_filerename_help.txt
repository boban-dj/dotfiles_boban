The renaming operation use a PREFIX then the renamed files are in form 
PREFIX_number.EXT

Menu:
Filters / Photolab / Batch work / Files rename


Parameters :

Directory = working directory in which the batch is running and the files to
handle are. The new created files are saved in the same directory and
prefixed with "BCS_", the old files are not deleted.

Extension = only the files with this extension will be treated

Prefix = the prefix used to rename the files


Text files :
File "prefix.txt" = if there is one in the working directory its content will be
used to rename the new files. The Prefix parameter is then no more used.
Encoding used to write this text file should be the same as your system.

Troubles :
If encoding of text file is not the one of the system then you can force
the encoding in the Python-fu at the section "System locale"

An option to order the files by EXIF date instead alphabetical order
