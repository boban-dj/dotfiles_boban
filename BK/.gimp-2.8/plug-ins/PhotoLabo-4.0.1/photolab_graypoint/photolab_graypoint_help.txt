Object :
Set a gray point in the image by adjusting the color channels. The channels are
not mixed only the weight of each channels is adjusted. The reference gray
point can be turned in a colored point in case of you don't have any "supposed"
pure grey in your photo. 


Menu:
Filters / Photolab / Graypoint
Filters / Photolab / Batch works / Graypoint

Usage :
First pick the Adusting color in the plug-in dialog to open the color selector
dialog and pick in the image the color you want turned to gray. Then set 
optionnaly the Reference gray point if you don't want a pure gray but a 
smoothly colored gray as Reference. Checking Ã«rserve White and Black is better
if you have pure white or black pixels in the image.


Parameters :

Directory = batch works only, working directory in which the batch is 
running and the files to handle are

File extension = batch works only, only the files with this extension will be 
treated

Destination directory = batch works only, the new created image will be saved in 
this directory. Source and Destination directory can be the same, the original 
image won't be overwrited. The name of the new image is suffixed with the word
BORDER 

Adjusting color = the color who will be turned into the reference gray. You can 
clic in the color to open the color selector dialog. From this dialog it's
possible to pick a color in the image. Also you can drag and drop any color 
from the toolbox.

Reference gray = the destination color of the adjusting color. 

Preserve White and Black = if you choose No (channel mixer) then the channel
mixer is used to adjust the gray point. In this case this is a linear change of
colors, white and black pixels also get new colors. If you choose Yes (curves) 
the curve tool is used to adjust the gray point. In this case this is a non
linear change of colors, white and black pixels don't change.
