Object : 
Create one or four mirror effects from a image. Works as standalone or in 
batch mode

Menu:
Filters / Photolab / Effect:mirror
Filters / Photolab / Batch works / Effect:mirror

Usage :
You can create one mirror effect or create the four possibilities of mirror
effects from a picture. Directly from GIMP, the active layer will be used to 
create the effect. You can choose to export the result in a directory instead of
creating the result as layer in your file. In batch mode, you are supposed to 
read jpeg or png flattened files.


Parameters :

Source directory = batch works only, working directory in which the batch is 
running and the files to handle are. 

File extension = batch works only, only the files with this extension will be 
treated

Destination directory = the new created mirror effect will be saved in this 
directory. Source and Destination directory can be the same, the original 
picture won't be overwrited. The name of the mirror effect are suffixed like 
MIRROR_type_of_mirror.

What to do ? = it's a choice between making the four effects possible or only
one as indicated below

Mirror orientation = Horizontal or vertical, works like the mirror tool of GIMP

Keep side = the side to be mirrored, it's left or right for horizontal mirror
and top or bottom for vertical mirror

Export = standalone only, export the result instead of create a new mirror 
effect layer in the original file

Export directory = standalone only, like Destination directory
