Object: 
Highlight the dark tones of an image.
Add a gray layer in Softlight mode and apply on it a mask made with the
Valu channel of the image. A pixel with a low Value is dark and then receive
more light than a pixel with a high Value.

Menu:
Filters / Photolab / Enlight the dark tones

Parameters:

Brightness = Luminosity given by the layer in softlight mode, 
from 0 to 255, 0 is neutral.


Notes:
Once the layer added you can always play with the fill color (in graytone)
to change the luminosity. Use preferably the Colorize tool of Gimp and
its Luminosity cursor.
