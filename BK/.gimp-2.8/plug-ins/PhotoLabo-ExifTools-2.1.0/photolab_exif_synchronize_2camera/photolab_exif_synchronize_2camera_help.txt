Object: 
A batch work applying at two sets of photos each taken from an other camera.
The photos have been taken at the same time and your wish is to merge them
in one single album. In order to have them in chronological order, a time offset
between the 2 internal time of the cameras is needed.

Dependencies :
The following software must be installed until Gimp won't be able to manage
EXIF datas from a script.
For the EXIF tools, you must install JHead at:
http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/ 

Menu:
Filters / Photolab / EXIF tools / Synchronize 2 cameras


Parameters:

First camera source directory = directory where the files to handle from the first 
camera are. The photos will be copied in the Merging destination directory.
The copies will be prefixed by the shouting date.

Extension = only the files with this extension will be treated. Apply to the files
of the first source directory.

Sign = add or substract time offset between the internal dates of the cameras ?

Days / Hours / Minutes / Seconds = numbers of days, hours, minutes,
seconds of the time offset

Second camera source directory = directory where the files to handle from the second 
camera are. The first and the second source directories can not be the same. The 
photos will be copied in the Merging destination directory. The copies will be prefixed by 
the shouting date.

Extension = only the files with this extension will be treated. Apply to the files
of the second source directory.

Merging destination directory = directory where the images are copied. The destination 
directory can be one of the source directory. In this case, the files of the source
directory identical at the destination directory won't be copied and the original files
will be modified.
